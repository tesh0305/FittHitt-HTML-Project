            <h3>Maintaining Weight</h3>
            <p>To Maintain Weight, aim to balance your caloric intake with 
                your activity level. Doing moderate cardio a few times a week while
                including some light full-body sessions helps you maintain weight while 
                improving cardiovascular fitness and energy levels,
                especially when it can be easy to eat more than you realise when training
                for building Strength and Muscle Mass.

        <div class ="goal">
            <h3>Building Muscle</h3>
            <p>To build muscle, you should aim to progressively overload the muscle group you are training.
                This means gradually increasing the weight, reps, or sets over time. Training in the 6-12 rep 
                range at 65-85% of your one-rep max is ideal for ideal muscle growth. Ensure proper form, rest 60-90 
                seconds between sets, eat sufficient protein, roughly 1.5 grams of protein for every kg of body weight, 
                and allow muscles 48-72 hours to recover before training the same group again.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="goal">
            <h3>Building Strength</h3>
            <p>Building strength typically involves lifting 80-90% (or more) of your one-rep max for 3-6 reps per set,
                focusing on compound movements with full recovery between sets and progressive overload over time.
                Compound lifts such as squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and overhead presses form the foundation of most strength programs.
                Rest periods of 2-5 minutes between sets are recommended to allow for full recovery and maximal effort in each set. Proper 
                technique and consistent progression are essential to avoid injury and ensure steady gains. Supporting your training with
                 adequate nutrition, hydration, and sleep further enhances strength development and overall performance.
